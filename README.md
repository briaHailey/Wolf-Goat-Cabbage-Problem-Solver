# Wolf-Goat-Cabbage-Problem-Solver
This project uses a depth first search algorithm to solve the wolf goat cabbage problem.
The farmer must bring the cabbage, goat, and wolf across the river without leaving the goat alone with
the cabbage or the wolf alone with the goat. Assume the boat can only hold the farmer and one other object.
